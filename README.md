1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry

software engineering is a brach of computer science that used in developing testing and maintaining software

Importances

It's reliable :ensure the performance is as expected without bais 

It's flexible :handles the load increase without affecting it's performance

It's efficient :helps to optimize developer while maintaining high standards

It's maintainable :software is easier to update,modify and enhance

2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  

Mastering coplexity :as softwares projects grew larger complexity became an issues hence leading to the introduction of structured programming such as c,pascal and etc

Mastering process :as software develpment grew ther was need for structured development processes to improve the quality and efficiency leading to the introduction of software development life cycle

Mastering machine :the increasing power of hardware lead to the emerge of programming paradigms to harness machine capabilities

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle

planning: identify software requirement or specification or purpose

requirement analysis: identify users specification

design: build the framework

coding:convert the software design into tangible codes

testing: examine the software for any bugs

4.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer

maintaining and updating software

developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.

reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer

understand and clarify software requirement.

create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow

develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools

Project Manager

discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers

tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone

create blueprint for the project

5.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Programming languages have rules: it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.

can format the written text by making the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.

Version Control Systems (VCS)

Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.

Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

6.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Limited Infrastructure: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.

Time Constraints: adopt agile methodologies to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 

Software Security: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats

7.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests: are close to the source of an application to ensure that each unit performs its intended function correctly

Integration tests: verify that different modules services used by your application work well together.

System testing: focus on the entire software system as a whole, It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements

Acceptance tests: formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements

8.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models

prompt engineering: is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs

Importance

Improved user experience by making it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt

Increased flexibility: a prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Developer control:  a prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI

9.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective
