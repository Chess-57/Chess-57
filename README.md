1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry

software engineering is a brach of computer science that used in developing testing and maintaining software

Importances

It's reliable :ensure the performance is as expected without bais 

It's flexible :handles the load increase without affecting it's performance

It's efficient :helps to optimize developer while maintaining high standards

It's maintainable :software is easier to update,modify and enhance

2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  

Mastering coplexity :as softwares projects grew larger complexity became an issues hence leading to the introduction of structured programming such as c,pascal and etc

Mastering process :as software develpment grew ther was need for structured development processes to improve the quality and efficiency leading to the introduction of software development life cycle

Mastering machine :the increasing power of hardware lead to the emerge of programming paradigms to harness machine capabilities

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle

planning: identify software requirement or specification or purpose

requirement analysis: identify users specification

design: build the framework

coding:convert the software design into tangible codes

testing: examine the software for any bugs

4.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer

maintaining and updating software

developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.

reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer

understand and clarify software requirement.

create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow

develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools

Project Manager

discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers

tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone

create blueprint for the project

5.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

6.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

7.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

8.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models

9.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective
